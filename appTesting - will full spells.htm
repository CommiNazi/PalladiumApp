Kick attacks have a 60% chance of causing the character to trip and fall down. Prowl rolls turn into clumsy rolls, making noise every time it is tried. All skills are at -40%, but only during critical situations. Other instances of bad luck are at the GM's discretion.

No matter how wild or mean the animal may have been, it will be instantly linked to the mage, becoming docile and submissive to him and him alone. The two are now one. The spell caster is its friend and master, an extension of the animal. The animal familiar will understand and obey any command, mental or verbal. For the mage, the familiar is now a sensory extension enabling him to see, hear, smell, taste, and feel everything the animal experiences. Thus, familiars make great spies, listening to conversations and prowling into areas not easily accessible to its master. Although the familiar understands and obeys its master, it can not actually speak to him. Just as the arcanist knows what the familiar is feeling, so does the familiar know what its master is experiencing. If one is in danger, the other will know it. Because of the magical nature of the union, the mage and familiar both get an additional six hit points. However, if the familiar is hurt or attacked, its master also takes the same damage, even if miles apart. If the familiar is killed, the arcanist permanently loses 10 hit points! There is a 50% chance he will also suffer shock from the ordeal; if he does, he will lapse into a coma for 1D6 hours. Another familiar link cannot be tried again for another 1.5 years.

The ritual involves treating pure linen strips of cloth with a mystic solution and wrapping the body in the cloth. The invocation brings to life (if you can call it that) a sort of humanoid robot that is devoid of emotions and fearless. Like a machine, the barely intelligent thing follows simple orders to the best of its ability. The mummy is incapable of understanding complex commands, or performing any skills. It is simply a lumbering corpse. Of course, this combined with its near indestructibility makes it an ideal guardian. A simple command like Kill all who enter, (with the exception of the mage) is all it needs to know. A mummy cannot speak (or read) but grunts, growls, and howls. The most devastating aspect of the damnable creature is that it is dead, and feels no pain or emotions. Bullets, knives, clubs, and even most magic have no effect against the monster. Physical attacks simply nick or poke holes into a lifeless husk. Magic charms, sleeps, curses, illusions, illness, paralysis, and turn dead (the mummy is an undead) do nothing at all. Banishment does not work because the mummy is not actually a living supernatural creature. Negation simply does not work, and remove curse is not applicable. The only way to stop a mummy is to: 1) Trap or imprison it. 2) Blow it to bits. 3) Burn it up. Note: Protection circles will hold a mummy at bay. Fire is its one major weakness and it knows that, so a wall of fire, torch, or flamethrower may also keep it at bay. The magic is present in both the dead body and the linen wrappings. If the wrappings are destroyed, fire does double damage to the corpse, and even sunlight will inflict 3D6 points of damage per melee of exposure. - see book for mummy stats"

	"description":" The zombie invocation is a necromantic ritual that turns a corpse into the undead. The create a zombie, the sorcerer must find a recently deceased body, no more than six hours dead, lay it on a while or silver linen, draw a circle around it, and light three scented candles. The candles are then placed on the body: one on the forehead, one on the mouth, and one on the chest above the heart. As the incantation reaches its climax, the mage cuts his finger and draws a pentagram on the corpse's throat with his still warm blood. Moments later, the monstrosity rises to pseudo-life, the obedient slave of its master. The ceremony must be done secretly in a graveyard or burial place during the night of a full moon. The zombie is more intelligent than the mummy, and can speak, read simple signs and sentences, perform simple tasks, and even drive a car. This means a zombie(s) can be sent to retrieve an artifact, follow somebody, kidnap a person, and so on. A zombie will only obey the person who created it and individuals whom its creator may designate as authorities. Like the mummy, a zombie is a walking corpse. It feels no pain, no fears, no goals, and little emotion. Bullets, knives, clubs, and other physical attacks do NO damage. Mental assaults by psychics, magic charms, illusions, sleeps, curses, sickness, paralysis, and other similar attacks do no damage. Turn dead does not work because the zombie is an undead. Banishment doesn't work because it is not actually a living supernatural being. Negation simply does not work, and remove curse is not applicable. However, the zombie is more vulnerable than the mummy, the trick is knowing what to use. A Zombie is vulnerable to magical energy attacks, such as energy bolt, fire bolt, circle of flame, and call lightning, all of which do full damage. Normal electricity, lasers, particle beam weapons, and similar energy weapons do half their normal damage. Normal fire inflicts full damage. Weapons made of, or covered in, silver will do full damage whether it be a blade or bullet. Zombies can also be trapped/imprisoned and blown up. Zombies will rise again, even if riddled with silver bullets or blown to bits, unless their heads are severed from their bodies and buried separately, or an exorcism is performed. Otherwise it will regenerate all SDC and body parts within 48 hours and seek out its master for new instructions. There is no limit to the number of zombies a mage can command. Horror stories in Haiti whisper of entire sugar cane plantations worked by zombie labourers. - see book for zombie stats"
