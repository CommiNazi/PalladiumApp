I finally had some time to start this, and Kelling helped me turn it into a nearly functional thing. (and then optimized and reworked portions of it, and generally had a good time with it.)

Throwing it here so anyone can look at it, or contribute if they are bored. Works ok so far, shows a list of spells, with images related to what type of spell it is (buff, debuff, healing, etc...). If you click a spell, it loads the full description.

to do:
* Make it look pretty. Has some basic stying only
* Update JSON 
     * about 80% of the RUE spells are added, need to eventually add the remainder and probably do a pass to make sure there are no horrible mistakes.
        * add spells from other sources as needed/desired
* whatever else people want to add.

Wish List, 
* Filters for various things (like maybe spell level, type of spell, ability to show only warlock elemental spells, etc...)
* ability to create a "spellbook" and select spells for it. So it would only show the selected spells based on the character
* Other info, like psionics, maybe common equipment/weapons
* other useful features like health or PPE trackers. Skill calculators, etc...
