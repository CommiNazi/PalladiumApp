I finally had some time to start this, and Kelling helped my throw it into a nearly functional thing.

Throwing it here so anyone can look at it, or contribute if they are bored. Works ok so far, shows a list of spells, with images related to what type of spell it is (buff, debuff, healing, etc...). If you click a spell, it loads the full description.

to do:
* Make it look pretty
* Update JSON 
     * inputting descriptions and if the spell allows for a saving throw
     * Change range and duration fields to reflect level increases for some spells
     * some spells shoudl have the duration changed from minutes to numer of melees
* let the App pull from an external JSON
* whatever else people want to add.


Wish List

* add a few simpe filters
* ability to create a "spellbook" that loads only known spells for different characers
* adding other useful features like health/PPE tracker
* Adding other info like Psionics, spells from additional books, common equipment, skill calculator, etc...
